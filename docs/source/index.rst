Activity Browser
================

The Activity Browser is a free `LCA <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment>`_ software.
It builds upon `brightway2 <http://brightwaylca.org/>`_ for much of its functionality (e.g. LCA calculations). It extends brightway2 through a graphical user interface (GUI) increasing the efficiency of certain tasks.

As it is open source, you can add your own extensions.


Features
--------

Core features currently involve:

- a graphical user interface (GUI) to brightway2
- fast browser-inspired navigation through inventory databases 
- creating and modifying inventories and databases
- fast LCA calculations (even multi-inventory-multi-method)


Extensions
----------

A tool for modeling life cycles based on a :ref:`Meta-Process Concept <metaprocess_introduction>`.
