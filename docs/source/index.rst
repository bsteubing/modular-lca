   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.


Activity Browser
================

The activity browser is a free `LCA <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment>`_ software.
It relies on `brightway2 <http://brightwaylca.org/>`_ for much of its functionality (e.g. LCA calculations and database management). It extends brightway2 through a graphical user interface (GUI) increasing the efficiency of certain tasks.

As it is open source, you can add your own extensions.
